## Graduate Student Opportunities
<br>

I am always looking for new MS and PhD graduate students.  Students should have be ambitious individuals with interest in hydroinformatics and/or hydrologic modeling.  Students are expected to become proficient in programming languages (e.g. Python, Matlab, C++) and cornerstone technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  Student research will be directed based upon funding source with the ultimate goal of peer-reviewed journal publications.  

A successful PhD student will publish 3 peer reviewed journal articles as well as present their work at one or more national conferences. These targets ensure that students will be competitive candidates for research and faculty positions upon graduation.

A successful MS student will publish 1 peer reviewed journal article and present their work at one national conference.  This target ensures that students will be competitive candidates for research-based consultants as well as PhD student positions.

## Undergraduate Student Opportunities
<br>

My research group leverages modeling software developed here at Utah State University.  I am continuously seeking undergraduate computer science students to continue development of these modeling tools.  Students may use this as a way to earn some extra money during the semester and to demonstrate on job applications there ability to transfer classroom skills to real-world problems.  Students that have worked on these modeling software tools have gone on to future careers in academia and industry.
